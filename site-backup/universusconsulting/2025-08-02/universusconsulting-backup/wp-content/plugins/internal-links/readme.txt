== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is internal linking and what is it good for? =
An __internal link__ is a link that is placed on a page which links to another page within the same domain. Internal links have an __extremely high value__ when it comes to __SEO__ and also the general __optimization__ of websites.

Internal links...

* have an immense influence on SEO
* help search engines find new content quickly
* help search engines to better interpret and classify the content of a page
* can distribute traffic to well converting subpages

On our website we created a [comprehensive guide about internal linking](https://www.internallinkjuicer.com/internal-links-guide/), where you will find a lot of knowledge and useful tips.

= Will the plugin slow down my site? =
Absolutely not. The __Internal Link Juicer__ was explicitly designed for __fast loading times__ and maximum performance. It solves the problem of generating links using its own index. This prevents additional delays while loading the frontend.

= Will the plugin improve my search engine rankings? =
Of course no guarantee can be given for this. But building __internal links__ within a website is a basic discipline for onpage SEO. Internal links help search engines to find your content faster and understand it better. Both are important parts for __good rankings__. We help you to massively improve the structure of intern links and even automate the whole process stress-free.

= Does the plugin change my content? =
__No__ - the plugin has its own index, where links that need to be created are efficiently stored. Whenever a page is rendered, the links are generated before output and your existing content is enriched with them. The content itself is not manipulated by the plugin.

= Does the plugin work with content generated from shortcodes? =
__Yes__ - the plugin works with content (within posts or pages) that gets generated through shortcodes.

= Can I disable linking on specific pages? =
Yes, at any time!  With our [blacklist feature](https://www.internallinkjuicer.com/docs/whitelist-blacklist/) you can easily disable the generation of links on individual pages.

= Can I change the style of the auto generated links? =
Yeah, definitely. With the help of our [templating system](https://www.internallinkjuicer.com/docs/link-templates/) you can change the output of your generated links in no time at all.

= Is Internal Link Juicer compatible with translation plugins? =
__Yes__ - we provide an own compatibility mode for WPML and Polylang as this has been requested by many users. We are planning to support more 3rd party plugins soon - requests always appreciated!

= How can I automate the setting of keywords if I have a lot of posts? =
We understand that, depending on the size of your website, it can be __difficult to enter keywords manually__. For this reason, we implemented the possibility to export all linkable content in the import/export area, __enrich it with your own sources, and re-import__ it afterward.

The Pro version also provides a direct import of __post (and term) titles__ or, if installed, __Yoast SEO and RankMath "focus keywords"__.

== Screenshots ==

1. Content Settings - You can configure posttypes to be used for linking. Individual posts that are to be excluded from building internal links within their content can be blacklisted. You can also specify maximum frequencies for the number of links.
2. Link Settings - Customize the output of the generated links and set them to nofollow if you want.
3. In this example, a post about the topic "Hyperlinks" (1) is currently edited. The heart of the plugin is the keyword editor (2). There you can store all keywords that should refer to the current article. In this example, an additional gap within the phrase ("clickable ... hyperlink") was configured. You can see the result on the next screenshot.
4. The frontend output of another article about the topic "Anchor text". The content contains a phrase, which corresponds to the configuration as seen in screenshot #3. The Internal Link Juicer automatically builds a link to the post about "Hyperlinks".
5. The dashboard - From there you gain insights in all built links and anchor texts.
6. The link detail view - Take a deeper look into your built links.
7. Import and Export Section - Here you can easily import and export plugin settings or your configured keywords.
